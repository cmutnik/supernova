\begin{abstract}
Using current data collection and reduction techniques, we plan to 
identify supernovae (SNe) faster and fainter than the All-Sky Automated 
Survey for Supernovae (ASASSN) team is able to. 
%With a declination limit of $-30^{\circ}$
We expect to identify all SNe, with $m>17.5$ and declinations above $-30\deg$, 
before ASASSN is able to.\\
%For SNe with $m>17.5$ and declination (dec) $>-30\deg$
%We expect to identify all supernovae (SN) above a declination of $-30\deg$, with $m>17.5$, before ASASSN is able to.\\

\indent The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASASSN) group 
collects data using eight $14~cm$ telescopes. Each night, these  
telescopes are able to cover roughly $20,000~deg^{2}$, reaching 
down to $\sim$17th magnitude.
%{\bf reword}\\
These eight telescopes are split evenly between two sites.
The first telescope array is located on Haleakala and began 
collecting data in December 2013. In July 2015, the second %telescope 
array became operational at the LCOGT Cerro Tololo station. 
This allows ASASSN to detect SNe in both hemispheres.

\subsection{ATLAS}
{\bf Cleanup \& reword this section.\\}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{} rename section specifically after telescope 02a?
	\item{} cite Tonry et al. (2011)~\cite{ATLAS_data}
	\item{} ATLAS specs~\cite{ATLAS_data}
	\item{} how data was collected
	\item{} how *.diff.fz is made - subtract wallpaper from reduced data
	\item{} how *.ddt is made
	\item{} what is starrat
	\item{} possible mention upcoming re--reduction of data
	%\item{} reduced data became good around 57364
	%\item{} cover full sky every 4 nights
	%\item{} ~~~important because SNe are short-lived
	%\item{} ~~~likely we will catch all Type Ia SNe
	%\item{} 5 obs/night gives low false alarm rate
	\item{} is there an offset in observation pattern?
\end{itemize}

\indent ATLAS began collecting data in June 2015. Reduction methods 
are always being refined and improved. Data reduced before 
ATLAS became truly operational, in December 2015, is not trusted.\\
%Although ATLAS came on-line in June 2015, data reduced before December 2015 is not trusted.

%
\indent Each night ATLAS covers {\bf $\sim$xx~deg$^{2}$} five times over. 
%Each night, ATLAS collects 5 sets of observationsobserves {\bf $\sim$xx~deg$^{2}$} of the sky. 
%Each night, ATLAS observes {\bf $\sim$xx~deg$^{2}$} of the sky. 
An object is determined to be real if it appears in all good 
observations overlapping that region of the sky. 
If an object appears in one of the images, it is expected to appear 
%in the other four images collected that night. 
in the other four images collected that night that overlap the same region on the sky. 
This {\bf expectation / requirement} drastically reduces the false alarm rate. 
%
%
\indent Prior to April 2016, ATLAS made four {\bf duplicate} observations per 
night. Increasing the number of observations per night from 4 to 5, 
while maintaining the same 4 day cadence required an upper limit to 
be placed at dec=+60\deg. This is shown by the dark gray region in 
the upper right hand corner of Figure~\ref{fig:dec_mjd}.
%
%
\indent With a relatively short average lifetime, detection of SNIa requires 
frequent coverage of the entire sky. Using current observation patterns,
ATLAS surveys the entire sky, between $-30\deg<dec<+60$, in just 4 nights. 
% allow for the entire sky to be surveyed every 4 nights. 
Five observations of the entire sky are recorded by ATLAS every four nights, 
making detection of all SNIa possible.


{\bf An offset in the observation pattern would allow objects that fall 
on the edge of a detector to be observed over 5 times a night...Does 
such an offset exist?}

%\begin{enumerate}
	%\item{} find asn SN in atlas data
	%\item{} use asn SN to restrict ATLAS classification variables
	%\item{} manually inspect results for SN classification

%{\bf [check date]\\}
{\bf possibly include starrat figure\\

\indent remake it\\
\indent identify exact dates shown by tiles}

\indent In order to assassinate ASASSN, 
%\indent Before assassinating ASASSN became a possibility,
it was necessary to show that ATLAS had the potential to find all of ASASSN discovered SNe. 
%%To refine our SNe search, a trial set was needed. SNe ASASSN team has been 
To do this, a list of all ASASSN discovered SNe was obtained~\cite{asn_data}. 
{\bf [--OR-- cite website using footnote]}
By October 11, 2016 
ASASSN has reported discovering 385 SNe. Many of these 
objects were reported before ATLAS was operation. Object cuts are discussed 
in~\cref{sec:expobs}. Once the data was properly culled, the remaining SNe 
%served as a {\bf sanity test / validity check}. {}
were found in observations made by ATLAS. 
One such SN is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ds9_ASASSN-16ke}.
Finding these SNe in the ATLAS 
data allowed restrictions to be placed on classification variables, drastically 
reducing the number of potential SNe candidates. With such a restricted object 
list, visually examination is able to be used in identifying SNe.\\ 
%These identified SNe allowed for the restriction of ATLAS classification variables.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\indent It has been shown that all ASASSN discovered SNe overlapping ATLAS 
observations in sky and time are detectable in ATLAS data. Restricting 
classification variables drastically reduces the false alarm rate, requiring 
visually inspection of fewer objects. This shows the ability for ATLAS to 
identify all SNe faster and fainter than ASASSN is able to.

{\bf Detection of all SNIa is possible using ATLAS.\\}
{\bf As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dec_mjd}, SNe that were not 
observed ATLAS fall on the edges of observation limits.\\}

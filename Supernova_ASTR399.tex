ATLAS is a project funded by NASA to find dangerous asteroids.  The
motivation and science justification was described 
{\bf by~\cite{ATLAS_data}. --OR--  Tonry (2011)}.
For the duration of this ASASSN project, ATLAS used an f/2, 0.5~m
Schmidt telescope on Haleakala and a 110~Mpixel detector to collect
30~deg$^2$ with each exposure.  This telescope was installed in Jun
2015, and achieved more or less continuous operation around Sep 2015.

ATLAS will shortly install a second telescope on Mauna Loa, and a
proposal to NASA is being evaluated to build two more units for the
southern hemisphere.

The pixel size is 1.86\arcsec\ and the field of view is
5.4$\times$5.4~deg.  The PSF is currently no better than 6.5\arcsec\
which degrades the limiting sensitivity by one magnitude.  The faulty
Schmidt corrector will be replaced in March 2017.  ATLAS uses two
filters ``$o$'' (essentially $r+i$) and ``$c$'' (essentially $g+r$),
changing according to the phase of the moon.

With the basic observation consisting of a 30~sec exposure and about 
13~sec of overhead, about 900 observations are collected per night.  
%The basic observation consists of 30~sec of shutter open and about
%13~sec of overhead, so that about 900 observations are collected per night.  
The observation strategy has varied since the telescope was
installed, but currently observes one of four Dec bands between $-40$
and $+60$ Dec, imaging each spot 5 times on a $\sim$15~min cadence.
The overlap between observations is about 0.4~deg, and they are
dithered by a random amount for a given night, so each objects is seen
5 or more times, depending on whether it falls in an overlap.  
Prior to Apr 2016, ATLAS collected 4 or more observations of each object 
per night. Increasing the number of observations per night from 4 to 5, 
while maintaining the same 4 day cadence, required an upper limit to 
be placed at a $+60$ Dec. This is shown by the dark gray region in 
the upper right hand corner of Figure~\ref{fig:dec_mjd}.

The observations are processed by the ATLAS pipeline which consists of
image flattening, star finding, star identification, high precision
fits to astrometry (typically RMS of 0.3\arcsec\ per star and more
than 10,000 stars) and photometry (typically 0.1~mag~RMS, limited by
{\bf current reference catalog)}, image differencing against a static sky
image, and detection of objects that have moved or changed.  
Difference imaging and the detection of changing objects 
are discussed in~\cref{sec:diffimg}.

\fi

Difference images are generated by subtracting the wallpaper from reduced 
images. This is done to isolate objects that are changing. Subtraction 
of a properly calibrated wallpaper will produced a difference image \\
containing only objects that are changing in the reduced images.  \\
{\bf with no objects that are static in the reduced images.  }\\
{\bf will remove all static objects from the difference image.  }\\

The ``wallpaper'' (static sky image) is the weighted sum of many, many
observations at each point in the sky.  ATLAS currently uses the
Alard algorithm {\bf (Alard \& Lupton, 1998)~\cite{Alard_algorithm}} for differencing, and the
differences are dominated by photon noise and by systematics from
saturated stars or flare artifacts from the Schmidt corrector.


{\bf\noindent include comparison figure?:\\ \indent red and diff imgs}


The ATLAS mission is to find moving objects, but our processing
automatically finds all stationary transients and variable stars as
well.  Once the image is differenced, the program tphot detects all
sources at 3-sigma, and cut that back to 5-sigma once each source
has been fitted and the detection significance is known.  
This is augmented by calculated RA, Dec, magnitudes, and other relevant
quantities into a ``ddt'' (difference detection table) file.

The most useful classification variable is ``starrat'' (star ratio), 
which is defined to be the ratio of flux on the original, un--subtracted 
image to flux on the difference image.  Both fluxes are measured using a 
circular aperture of 2.0~pixel radius.  The star ratio is used in 
determining if an object is real or just a residuals from subtracted stars.  
For these, the star ratio will be large (usually greater than 5) because 
the star was much brighter before it was subtracted.  For asteroids and 
supernovae, we expect the star ratio to be near 1.0.  Since they are not 
usually in their recorded locations, such objects should not show up in the wallpaper.  
%Any object that isn't in the wallpaper is left unchanged by difference imaging, causing the recorded flux to be the same both before and after image subtraction, and resulting in a starrat of 1.0.
Any object that isn't in the wallpaper is left unchanged by difference imaging.  
This means the recorded flux to be the same both before and after image subtraction, 
resulting in starrat=1.0.

{\bf possibly include starrat figure here}\\
{\bf in results section get into the range for starrat values}

Difficulties include cases where a real transient can produce a high 
starrat, and cases where a false detection from a star residual can 
produce a low starrat. The former arise from the fact that supernovae 
happen in galaxies, which do get subtracted and can raise starrat 
substantially above 1.0 if they are bright. The latter can occur when 
we have a star residual detection substantially off-center from the 
star, so the flux on the un--subtracted image is not as bright as we might 
expect, and starrat can be lowered to the 2-5 range, or in some odd 
cases can be negative. So starrat is not foolproof. Nevertheless, a 
starrat value near 1.0, especially if accompanied by other indications 
such as consistent astrometry, is a useful piece of evidence pointing 
toward a real SN, asteroid, or other interesting transient.

\indent In order to assassinate ASASSN, 
%\indent Before assassinating ASASSN became a possibility,
it was necessary to show that ATLAS had the potential to find all of ASASSN discovered SNe. 
%%To refine our SNe search, a trial set was needed. SNe ASASSN team has been 
To do this, a list of all ASASSN discovered SNe was obtained~\cite{asn_data}. 
{\bf [--OR-- cite website using footnote]}
By October 11, 2016 
ASASSN has reported discovering 385 SNe. Many of these 
objects were reported before ATLAS was operation. Object cuts are discussed 
in~\cref{sec:expobs}. Once the data was properly culled, the remaining SNe 
%served as a {\bf sanity test / validity check}. {}
were found in observations made by ATLAS. 
One such SN is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ds9_ASASSN-16ke}.
Finding these SNe in the ATLAS 
data allowed restrictions to be placed on classification variables, drastically 
reducing the number of potential SNe candidates. With such a restricted object 
list, visually examination is able to be used in identifying SNe.\\ 
%These identified SNe allowed for the restriction of ATLAS classification variables.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\indent It has been shown that all ASASSN discovered SNe overlapping ATLAS 
observations in sky and time are detectable in ATLAS data. Restricting 
classification variables drastically reduces the false alarm rate, requiring 
visually inspection of fewer objects. This shows the ability for ATLAS to 
identify all SNe faster and fainter than ASASSN is able to.

ATLAS surveys the entire sky, between $-30$ and $+60$ Dec, in just 4 nights. 
Five observations of the entire sky are recorded by ATLAS every four nights, 
making detection of all SNIa possible.

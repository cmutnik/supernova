\begin{abstract}
Using current data collection and reduction techniques, we plan to 
identify supernovae (SNe) faster and fainter than the All-Sky Automated 
Survey for Supernovae (ASASSN) team is able to. 
%With a declination limit of $-30^{\circ}$
We expect to identify all SNe, with $m>17.5$ and declinations above $-30\deg$, 
before ASASSN is able to.\\
%For SNe with $m>17.5$ and declination (dec) $>-30\deg$
%We expect to identify all supernovae (SN) above a declination of $-30\deg$, with $m>17.5$, before ASASSN is able to.\\
{\bf m$>$17.5 --OR-- $m>17.5$}\\
{\bf 17.5 (0.5mag) --OR-- 18 (1mag) fainter...which is it?}\\
{\bf not emphasis on Type Ia supernovae?}

\subsection{ASASSN Data}
\begin{itemize}
	%\item{} {\bf Where'd it come from}
	%\item{} {\bf ASASSN specs}
	\item{} {\bf ASASSN or ASAS--SN}
	%\item{} {\bf images have 7.8\arcsec pixels}
\end{itemize}


\indent The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASASSN) group 
collects data using eight $14~cm$ telescopes. Each night, these  
telescopes are able to cover roughly $20,000~deg^{2}$, reaching 
down to $\sim$17th magnitude.
%{\bf reword}\\
These eight telescopes are split evenly between two sites.
The first telescope array is located on Haleakala and began 
collecting data in December 2013. In July 2015, the second %telescope 
array became operational at the LCOGT Cerro Tololo station. 
This allows ASASSN to detect SNe in both hemispheres.

\indent Using 400mm f/2.8G Nikon lenses allows for a large field of 
view. ProLine PL230 CCD cameras are used as detectors. Detection of 
%Transients are detected using image subtractions. 
transients is made possible using image subtraction. With images 
having 7.8\arcsec pixels, ASASSN relies on volunteers collecting  
confirmation images with larger telescopes.

%data collected by two 14--cm telescopes\\
%one at Haleakala, the other at the LCOGT Cerro Tololo station.\\
%first guy started in December 2013...second came online in July 2015.\\
%these two currently cover roughly 20,000~$deg^{2}$ a night\\
%down to 17th mag\\
%they eventually plan to survey the entire sky, every night, down to 17th mag, using 16 scopes at 4 diff sites\\

\end{itemize}



\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{} find asn SN in atlas data
	\item{} use asn SN to restrict ATLAS classification variables
	\item{} manually inspect results for SN classification

\section{Discussion}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{} what restrictions we intend to place on classification variables like starrat
	\item{} possibly describe what starrat is, how it will help id SN
	\item{} such restrictions cut the number of objects down from xx to $\sim$1000/2000
